# The-transplanting-of-programs-compiled-by-Intel-cluster
If the computing programs like VASP, LAMMPS, CP2K ect compiled by Intel cluster, and your Linux machine has already possessed Intel cluster after 2019, you can load the files and give them authority by comands like `chmod 777 filename` or `chmod u=x filename`. Then you can use them to do compute expediently!
